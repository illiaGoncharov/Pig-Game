            The game has 2 players, playing in rounds. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Each result get added to his ROUND score. 
            <br>
            <br>
            BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After that, it's the next player's turn. 
            <br>
            <br>
            AND, if the player rolls two 6, ALL his scores get lost. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After that, it's the next player's turn. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After that, it's the next player's turn. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The first player to reach 200 or Specified Winner Score (bottom of the page) points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
